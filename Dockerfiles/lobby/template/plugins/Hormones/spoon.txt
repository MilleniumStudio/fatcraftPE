    The author of this plugin does not provide support for third-party builds of
    PocketMine-MP (spoons). Spoons detract from the overall quality of the MCPE plugin environment, which is already
    lacking in quality. They force plugin developers to waste time trying to support conflicting APIs.

    In order to begin using this plugin you must understand that you will be offered no support.

    Furthermore, the GitHub issue tracker for this project is targeted at vanilla PocketMine only. Any bugs you create which don't affect vanilla PocketMine will be deleted.

    Have you read and understood the above (type 'yes' after the question mark)?yes
